Practical spam prevention for Elementor Forms, without relying on third-party services.

== Description ==

Antispam for Elementor Forms adds two methods of preventing spam submissions to Elementor Pro forms - checking the form contents against the WordPress comment blocklist, which is automatically synced daily, and a JavaScript-based honeypot field, with an optional minimum time to fill out the form.

**Privacy disclaimer**

This plugin uses the WordPress comment blocklist from GitHub (https://github.com/splorp/wordpress-comment-blacklist, via the raw.githubusercontent.com domain). It is synced daily. Your server's IP address will be shared with GitHub when this happens. Their terms of use can be found here: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service and their privacy statement can be found here: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement No data about your users is shared.

== Installation ==
1) Install the plugin from the WordPress Plugin Directory.
2a) Checks against the comment blocklist are performed automatically, but further configuration can be done in Elementor -> Settings, in the Antispam for Elementor Forms tab.
2b) The JS Honeypot field must be manually added to forms which require it.
